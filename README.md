Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining : This subject is combination of data Analytics and Machine learning. It requires you to do data preprocessing ,Exploratory data Analysis,Feature Encoding,sampling,data cleaning 
bascially all CRISP data modelling techniques inorder to fit a ML model. Evaluation techniques are applied on the model generated to determine the efficiency of model.

Me and my team members we created project called Credit Card fraud detection to determine the fraudalent transactions provided in the csv files. We used all above techniques and various ML models to analyse a transaction 
as fraud or not fraud based on criteria provided.

Technology used: Python,Matplotlib,Sklearn,R studio,Jupyter Notebook, Google Collab
